# Breast-Cancer-Classification
<i>Predicting if the breast cancer is benign or malignant based on several observations/features<br>
30 features are used, examples:

  - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
  - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
  - perimeter
  - area
  - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
  - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
  - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
  - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
  - symmetry 
  - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)<br><br>
Number of Instances: 569
Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign<br><br>
<b>Target class</b> :
   -   Malignant
